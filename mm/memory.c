 * Ok, demand-loading was easy, shared pages a little bit tricker. Shared
 * pages started 02.12.91, seems to work. - Linus.
 *
 * Tested sharing by executing about 30 /bin/sh: under the old kernel it
 * would have taken more than the 6M I have free, but it worked well as
 * far as I could see.
 *
 * Also corrected some "invalidate()"s - I wasn't doing enough of them.

 * that would lead to some serious memory waste - we just copy the
 * first 160 pages - 640kB. Even that is more than we need, but it
 * doesn't take any more memory - we don't copy-on-write in the low
 * 1 Mb-range, so the pages can be shared with the kernel. Thus the
